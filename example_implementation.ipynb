    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Kwansi is a wrapper for [DSPy](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app), a framework for programming - not prompting - language models. DSPy is a powerful, modular tool that assists the way we work with language models (LMs) in complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kwansi builds upon DSPy's capabilities with a focus on making making its optimizers easier to use - especially if you are using LLM-based evaluators. You can find more information about Kwansi and its implemented functions here: https://github.com/lordamp/kwansi\n",

    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We have written a simple prompt for creating tweets based on a given topic and details. We want to optimize this prompt.\n",

    "### Add More/Different Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you also find out that you will need more context for the task to work, so you will have to add additional data and input fields. For example, `appropriateness` might be different for various target groups, so including the age group or interests of the author might be necessary - if you have that data!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tweak the Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you might also want to tweak your task, especially if you see that your optimizer can't get above the threshold you set. For example, in writing this example, it became clear that the task needed an instruction on avoiding hashtags, otherwise the task would always produce them and get a 0 score in the `Hashtag_Count` metric, leading to an evaluator score of 0. If you have used COPRO or MIPROv2 to optimize your prompt, you can also take this optimized instruction and add it as the new student for the next iteration.\n",
